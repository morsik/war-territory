// Sys_SnapVector NASM code (Andrew Henderson)
// See win32/win_shared.c for the Win32 equivalent
// This code is provided to ensure that the
//  rounding behavior (and, if necessary, the
//  precision) of DLL and QVM code are identical
//  e.g. for network-visible operations.
// See ftol.nasm for operations on a single float,
//  as used in compiled VM and DLL code that does
//  not use this system trap.
